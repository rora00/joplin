February 2020 
Business in the digital age Guest Lecture
Christina Albert: UK Operations Manager, AXA Commercial Delegated Authority

## Digital disruption @ AXA
* Insurance is a highly disruptive industry
* AXA is 204 years old, complexity breeds complexity

### Policy administration platform

* They wanted to add extra features such as a 'rules engine'
* Whole system becomes more and more complex and becomes very difficult to change

### High competitition to excel in digital change
* Existing competitors
	* Allianz
	* Aviva
	* Zurich
* Disruptors in the market
	* Lemonade uses AI to (1) select the best risks (2) settles claims very quickly using facial lie recognition

## AXA Commercial Delegated Authority (CDA)
* 1/3 of the AXA business of the 1.3B business is CDA
* CDA
	* Delegated authority contracts
	* Funding
	* Compliance
	* Claims
	* International territories
	* Business strategy

## Insurance and Autonomous vehicles: Who do we insure with autonomous vehicles?

* 30k road injuries caused by road accidents
* 1k road deaths caused by road accidents
* AXA is a diverse group of risks so not as affected, but mono-insurance provides (e.g. auto insurance providers will struggle with the introduction of significantly safer autonomous vehicles)
* AXA has 5 research funds on autonomous vehicles 
	* Levels 1, 2 and 3 are already being serviced
	* Level 4 and 5 of autonomy require new products and innovation from AXA. Currently insurance insures the person driving the car.
* At this point, AXA needs cyber cover. Cars can be hacked and present grave consequences.
* Underwriting is the process of gathering a lot of background information about a claim to make a judgment on the insurance claim
* AXA's biggest digital priority is to take the various pieces of information into a centralized dataset and make a judgement quickly

## Challenges for AXA
* Increased regulation is the main one, constant changing pressures from the government
	- Changes for AXA that have gone well
