## Human foot skin
* Human foot skin has been found to be up to ~40x more durable (?) than skin on the rest of the body
* Collegen concentration is significantly higher in the foot skin compared to the rest of the body. This explains its tensile strength
* Research at Imperial College London is looking into how to artificially introduce collegen into skin elsewhere in the body, which is especially useful for amputees with 'stumps' that have weak skin on their stumps

## Skin mites
* Research done in University of West England looking at the presence of skin mites in various populations of humans, which can help trace ancestry
* Skin sample from forehead is taken using glue, and analysed 300x under a microscope, to reveal skin mites that feed of oils near hair follicles
* Skin mites mate on the surface of skin at night
* Skin mites are not present on babies still in the womb

## Rhino
* Extremely tough skin around 4cm thick
* Can fend of predeators like lions or cheetahs
* Thick skin evolved to fight other rhinos for territory, they are over-protected against predeators
* Rhinos typically weigh around 3.5 tons (3500 kg)
* Baby rhinos need around 2 years before their skin is fully developed for defense, so their mothers are over-protective

## Tigers
* Although tigers seem very colorful, to most of their prey (deer) who have bi-chromatic vision, tigers camoflauge very well into their surroundings
* Monkeys (...) can warn deer that a tiger is around because they have full-color vision

## Frogs
* Permeable skin that needs to be kept moist to ensure that oxygen transfer occurs through the skin
* Dart frogs (...) have poisonous skin
	* that are sourced from the flies (...) that they eat. When bred without being in the wild, their skins do not produce these toxins. 
	* Scientists are investigating how these secretions are produced as they have paralyzing effects, which can be used in medicine if they figure out how to isolate the paralyzing effect from the toxin.
* One species of frog (...) can survive underwater indefinitely, as it has large folds of skin that can allow it to absorb enough oxygen to survive.

## Birds
* Birds (...) that have giant inflatable skin sacs around their neck, red colour, that are used to attract mates

## Rattlesnakes
* Have rattles that vibrate around 50hz, research (...) examines how this frequency is achieved by the snakes

## Porcupines
* Porcupines can fend off some of the deadliest predeators, like cheetahs
* African porcupines have very long, thick spines that can pierce deep but can be pulled out easily
* North american porcupines have short, thinner spines with backward prongs that make it much harder to pull out once pierced
	* Dogs often get pierced mistaking the porcupine as something they can play with

## Cuttlefish, Octpus and Squid
* Cuttlefish and other (...) like octupus and squid are soft, so they are very vulnerable to predeators. Thus, they camoflauge into their surroundings so that the predeators cannot detect them
* Research by London's Aquatic Marine (...)(?) shows that cuttlefish skin camoflauges with its surroundings using pigments controlled by muscle contractions
* New research is being conducted on the skin of cuttlefish being used as a sensory organ, instead of just eyes
* Some species of (...) can also change the texture of their skin to match their surrounding (...)
