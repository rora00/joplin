* Cave formations are typically formed by water flows
* Stalegtite and Stalegmites are formed with material that drips and then solidifies (what material). Columns are created when stalegtites and stalegmites join

## Aztec caves 
* Featured natural 'pools' but turned out to be 100s of miles of intricate underwater cave systems
	* Underwater cave exploration included squeezing through tight gaps, which are dangerous due to their ability to damage life-saving equipment
	* These dark caves can support a surprising amount of life
	
## One of the largest underground cave systems (name unknown)
* Found by digging through loose rocks at the bottom of a ravine (where?)
* 120 miles of passageways
* Cave was formed due to the erosion of limestone by Sulphuric Acid
* Featured large crystals, with one specific cavern containing one of the largest crystal formations in the world
* Sulphuric acid when reacting with limestone in these caves produce stunning crystal formations

## Cave eroded with sulphur-infused water (name unknown)
* Explorers went in with breathing apparatus and early-detection systems to indicate a high presence of sulphur gas
* Sulphur was emited from underground oil reserves and reacted oxygen in the cave water to product sulphuric acid
* This sulphuric acid (or some compound of it) is used as energy by a special form of bacteria, that is a type of bacteria that thrives in extreme environments such as these
	* The bacteria produces formations called 'snots', appropriately named due to its similar apperace to nose snot
	* The snot drips concentrated sulphuric acid, which can burn human skin
	* Insects (name unknown) feed of these bacteria
* There are species of fish that have adapted to live in these environments with reduced oxygen and in the presence of sulphur

## Belizian caves
* Rare salamander species
	* <100 surviving in the wild (?)
	* Skin lost pigmentation
	* No eyes, and evolving without eyes typically takes 1000s of years, which is why it is uncommon to find this trait
	* Extremely sensitive skin that can detect a change in water current caused by its prey
	* Have external gills to adapt to the low-oxygen environment
* Crab
	* Have very thin, spiky claws (unknown purpose)
* (unknown) water animal
	* Thin, size of hand, pinkish-colorless
	* Small and contain fibres on its skin to help grip on to rocks in fast moving current
	* Adapted to eat prey flowing in its currents
