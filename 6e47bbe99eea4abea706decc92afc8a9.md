## 4 Key takeaways
* "I look down and fix the potholes in front of me so that I don't fall rather than staring up at the clouds"
* Linus invented git so that his original project (Linux) would work properly when open-source contribution exploded.
* He said that if he were "stranded on an island and had to design a functional UI, he would die." 
* Linus compares himself to Edison rather than Tesla. He says that while Tesla was a visionary and had many "crazy ideas", Edison was the one that "actually changed the world"
* Linus was stubborn, but credited this trait to the persistence he had for developing it for 25+ years. Linus worked in silicon valley for 7 years, which is typically unheard of.
