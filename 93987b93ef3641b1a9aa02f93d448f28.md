## Features of git

2. Ability to create branches to work on code seperately to the main workflow

### Basics
`git init` creates a repository in that current directory

`git add [] [] []` adds a file/multiple files into a temporary zone before committing changes. Many files can be added to this zone

`git add .` adds all the files to the zone

`git commit -m` commits the changes to the repository. 
* `-m` can be used to add a message briefly describing the commit made.
* Each commit comes with a respective `commit-hash`:
```
commit 461c72e14ce1285e808e918417dbfaa6af0e130f (HEAD -> master, origin/master)
```

### Viewing what just happened
`git status` views if any changes are committed in that branch

`git log` shows a log of all of **my** commits

### Restoring old versions of the repo
`git checkout [commit-hash]` opens the version of the repo specified by the `commit-hash`. This can be copied from `git log`

`git checkout master` goes back to the latest version

### Branches
A branch is an individual timeline that can be developed in parallel to the master branch. These branches can then be merged if appropriate

`git branch` views all branches

`git checkout [branch-name]` switches to branch `branch-name`

`git branch []` creates a new branch

`git merge [branch-name]` merges the branch into the current branch (typically `master`)

`git merge -d [branch-name]` deletes the branch
